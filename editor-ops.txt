summary of relational operators
from /a relational program for a syntax directed editor/
----------------------------------------------------------------
x | y        union
x & y        intersection
x - y        difference
x : y        ordered pair
x = y        equality
x := y       assignment to variable
x / y        extension, = x | ( non. dom x -> y )
(py)         bind right argument of p to y
(xp)         bind left argument of p to x
(p)          operator used as operand
f^_1         inverse/converse
non x        complement of set or function
f . g        composition of f and g
f ; g        relative product (reverse composition)
f x          functional application
x , y        sequence construction
f $ r        isomorphic image of a relation ((f inv) R f)
while(x,y)   iterative application
x X y        cartesian product
x -> f       restrict domain
f <- x       restrict codomain
f <> x       restrict both domains
img f        image function
f*           reflexive transitive closure
f+           transitive closure
un           unit-set constructor
f||g         parallel application
f#g          construction
Id           identity function (equivalent to =)
f@x          f reduction with initial value x
first        first member of a relation (also second, etc.)
dom f        domain of function or relation
x≍y          define x to be y
x∈y          set memembership
